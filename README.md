I am creating an impossible list of my own, as Jade has done. I want to do this, because I think a life without a goal is meaningless. I also think marking goals for me are important, because even small achievements are worth remembering. It does not have always to be fame and being rich. I also want to push myself to achieve more ambitious goal.
